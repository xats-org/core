| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bloomsLevel` | `string` (enum) | **Yes** | Bloom's taxonomy cognitive level: "remember", "understand", "apply", "analyze", "evaluate", or "create". |
| `difficulty` | `integer` (1-5) | **Yes** | Difficulty level from 1 (easiest) to 5 (hardest). |
| `estimatedTimeMinutes` | `integer` (â‰¥1) | **Yes** | Estimated completion time in minutes. |
| `cognitiveLoad` | `string` (enum) | No | Expected cognitive load level: "low", "medium", or "high". |

## Notes

- Bloom's taxonomy levels progress from lower-order thinking (remember, understand) to higher-order thinking (analyze, evaluate, create)
- Difficulty ratings should be consistent within a course or learning context
- Estimated time helps students plan their study sessions and helps instructors design appropriate assessments
- Cognitive load information supports adaptive learning systems and accessibility considerations
