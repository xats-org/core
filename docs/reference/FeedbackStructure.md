## Notes

- Feedback should be constructive and educational, not just correctness indicators
- Progressive hints allow students to work through problems with scaffolded support
- Explanation arrays are particularly valuable for multiple choice questions to address common misconceptions
- Point penalties for hints encourage independent problem-solving while still providing support
- Immediate feedback can provide encouragement regardless of answer correctness
