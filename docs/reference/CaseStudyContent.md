### Description

The `CaseStudyContent` object defines comprehensive case-based learning scenarios for business, law, medicine, and other professional education contexts. Enhanced in v0.5.0 with sophisticated stakeholder modeling, structured complications, expert solution integration, and teaching guidance features.

Case study blocks present complex, realistic scenarios that require analysis, evaluation, and decision-making skills. They are particularly effective for connecting theoretical knowledge to practical application and developing professional reasoning capabilities.
