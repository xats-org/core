# `WorkedExampleContent`

**Type:** `object`  
**Introduced in:** v0.5.0  
**Block Type URI:** `https://xats.org/vocabularies/blocks/workedExample`

---

### Description

The `WorkedExampleContent` object defines step-by-step worked examples with progressive fading support and scaffolded practice problems. This content type facilitates skill acquisition and transfer by demonstrating expert problem-solving procedures through detailed solutions with gradually decreasing support levels.

Worked examples are particularly effective for teaching procedural knowledge, problem-solving strategies, and complex cognitive skills. The progressive fading system supports learners as they transition from guided practice to independent application.

### Usage Notes

**Pedagogical Applications:**
- Teaching mathematical procedures and algorithms
- Demonstrating scientific problem-solving methods
- Training professional decision-making processes
- Building computational thinking skills

**Progressive Fading Strategy:**
- **Level 0**: Complete worked example with full explanations (modeling)
- **Level 1**: Partial scaffolding with strategic hints (guided practice)
- **Level 2**: Minimal support requiring student completion (coached practice)
- **Level 3**: Independent practice with feedback only

**Cognitive Load Management:**
- Break complex procedures into discrete steps
- Provide both procedural and conceptual explanations
- Use consistent notation and terminology
- Sequence practice problems from high to low scaffolding

**Assessment Integration:**
- Monitor completion of practice problems
- Track which hints students access most frequently
- Assess transfer to novel problem contexts
- Evaluate explanation quality in student work
