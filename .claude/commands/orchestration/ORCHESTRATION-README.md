# Task Orchestration System Guide

A simple, powerful system that helps you organize and track your development work. Think of it as your personal project assistant that breaks down big ideas into manageable tasks and keeps everything organized.

## What Does It Do?

Imagine you have a big project like "build a user login system." This tool:
- 📝 Breaks it down into smaller tasks (like "create login form" and "add password reset")
- 📊 Keeps track of what's done, what's being worked on, and what's next
- 🔄 Syncs with Git to track your actual code changes
- 💾 Saves everything so you can pick up where you left off

## Quick Start Guide

### Starting a New Project

Simply tell the system what you want to build:

```
/orchestration/start
I need to build a user authentication system with:
- Login and logout
- Password reset via email
- Remember me functionality
- Social media login (Google and Facebook)
```

The system will:
1. Ask clarifying questions if needed
2. Create organized task files
3. Set up a tracking system
4. Give you a clear plan to follow

### Checking Your Progress

See what's happening at any time:

```
/orchestration/status
```

This shows you:
- ✅ What's completed
- 🔄 What's being worked on
- 📋 What's ready to start
- ⏸️ What's blocked

### Continuing After a Break

Left for lunch? Changed computers? No problem:

```
/orchestration/resume
```

This brings back everything:
- Where you left off
- What file you were working on
- What's next to do
- Any important notes

## Essential Commands

Here are the main commands you'll use:

| Command | What it does | When to use it |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| `/orchestration/start` | Begin a new project | Starting fresh work |
| `/orchestration/status` | Check progress | See what's happening |
| `/orchestration/resume` | Continue working | After any break |
| `/orchestration/move` | Update task status | When you complete something |
| `/orchestration/commit` | Save to Git | When code is ready |

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Starting Your Monday

```
/orchestration/resume

> You have 3 active projects:
> 1. authentication_system (65% done)
> 2. payment_processing (40% done)  
> 3. admin_dashboard (85% done)
>
> Which one? [1]
```

### Example 2: Finishing a Task

When you complete something:
```
/orchestration/move TASK-003 qa

> Moving "Add login form" to testing
> Ready to commit your changes? [Y/n]
```

### Example 3: Creating a Git Commit

The system helps you make professional commits:
```
/orchestration/commit

> Creating commit for TASK-003: Add login form
> Generated message:
> "feat(auth): implement user login form
>  
>  - Add email/password fields
>  - Include validation
>  - Add remember me checkbox
>  
>  Task: TASK-003"
```

## Task Organization

Your tasks are organized like a filing cabinet:

📁 **todos/** - Tasks ready to start  
📁 **in_progress/** - What you're working on now  
📁 **qa/** - Finished but needs testing  
📁 **completed/** - All done!  
📁 **on_hold/** - Waiting for something

- Check status when confused
- Commit completed work promptly

## How Files Are Organized

The system creates a special folder structure:

```
📁 task-orchestration/
  📁 03_15_2024/                    # Today's date
    📁 authentication_system/       # Your project
      📄 MASTER-COORDINATION.md     # The plan
      📄 EXECUTION-TRACKER.md       # Progress tracker
      📁 tasks/                     # All your tasks
        📁 todos/                   # Ready to start
        📁 in_progress/             # Working on now
        📁 completed/               # Finished!
```

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't find my task"
```
/orchestration/find "task name"     # Search by name
/orchestration/status               # See all tasks
```

### "I'm not sure what to work on"
```
/orchestration/resume               # Shows what's next
/orchestration/find --ready         # Shows available tasks
```

### "Git and tasks don't match"
```
/orchestration/sync                 # Fixes mismatches
/orchestration/sync --check         # Just see differences
```
