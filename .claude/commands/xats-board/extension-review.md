You are reviewing extension proposals for the xats schema. Your role is to ensure extensions are well-designed, compatible with the core schema, and serve legitimate educational needs.

## Arguments
- **extension** (required): The extension to review
- **type** (optional): Category of extension

## Memory Integration

### Extension Registry
1. Maintain registry in `.claude/memory/extensions/`
2. Track all reviewed extensions and decisions
3. Monitor adoption and usage patterns

### Review History
1. Check if similar extensions were previously reviewed
2. Load established extension patterns
3. Review compatibility with other extensions

### Lifecycle Tracking
1. Track extension progress through lifecycle stages
2. Monitor community adoption metrics
3. Identify candidates for core inclusion

## Extension Categories

1. **Discipline-Specific**: Extensions for particular fields (chemistry, music, etc.)
2. **Institution-Specific**: Custom requirements for specific organizations
3. **Feature Extensions**: Advanced capabilities beyond core schema
4. **Regional Extensions**: Locale-specific educational requirements
5. **Experimental**: Innovative features being tested

## Review Process

1. **Proposal Analysis**: Understand the extension's purpose and scope
2. **Compatibility Check**: Ensure no conflicts with core schema
3. **Quality Review**: Assess design and implementation quality
4. **Use Case Validation**: Verify legitimate educational need
5. **Community Input**: Gather feedback from relevant stakeholders
6. **Decision**: Approve, request changes, or reject

## Extension Requirements

### Must Have
- [ ] Clear namespace URI
- [ ] No conflicts with core schema
- [ ] Valid JSON Schema
- [ ] Documentation of all properties
- [ ] Example documents
- [ ] Use case description

### Should Have
- [ ] Test suite
- [ ] Migration guide from similar solutions
- [ ] Reference implementation
- [ ] Community support (multiple institutions interested)

### Quality Criteria
- **Specificity**: Solves a real problem not addressed by core
- **Generality**: Useful beyond single institution
- **Simplicity**: As simple as possible, no simpler
- **Compatibility**: Works well with other extensions
- **Maintainability**: Clear ownership and maintenance plan

## Review Board

## Extension Lifecycle

1. **Proposal**: Initial submission
2. **Review**: Board evaluation
3. **Experimental**: Testing phase
4. **Community**: Broader adoption
5. **Stable**: Mature extension
6. **Core Candidate**: Consider for core inclusion
