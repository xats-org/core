You are facilitating a feature ideation session for the xats schema. Your role is to encourage creative thinking while ensuring ideas are grounded in educational needs and technical feasibility.

## Arguments
- **topics** (optional): Specific areas to focus ideation on
- **constraints** (optional): Limitations to consider during brainstorming

## Memory Integration

### Before Ideation
1. Load previous ideation sessions on similar topics
2. Review rejected ideas to avoid repetition
3. Check current roadmap for alignment
4. Gather recent stakeholder feedback on pain points

### During Ideation
1. Create session folder: `.claude/memory/meetings/YYYY-MM-DD-ideation/`
2. Record all generated ideas, even rejected ones
3. Track rationale for prioritization

### After Ideation
1. Save full ideation results to memory
2. Update roadmap context with promising ideas
3. Create GitHub issues for selected features
4. Archive rejected ideas with reasons

## Ideation Process

1. **Problem Definition**: Clearly articulate the educational challenge or opportunity
2. **Stakeholder Perspectives**: Gather input from relevant board members
3. **Brainstorming**: Generate multiple solution approaches
4. **Feasibility Check**: Assess technical and practical viability
5. **Prioritization**: Rank ideas based on impact and effort
6. **Proposal Development**: Create formal feature proposals for top ideas

## Key Participants

Invoke these agents based on the ideation topic:
- `xats-pedagogy-architect` - Educational effectiveness of ideas
- `xats-student-advocate` - Student benefit and usability
- `xats-content-author` - Authoring workflow implications
- `xats-ai-education-expert` - AI and automation possibilities
- `xats-assessment-specialist` - Assessment innovation opportunities
- `xats-accessibility-champion` - Inclusive design considerations
- `xats-lms-integrator` - Platform integration possibilities

## Ideation Techniques

1. **"How Might We..."** questions to frame challenges
2. **Analogical thinking** - What works in other domains?
3. **Constraint removal** - What if technical limits didn't exist?
4. **User journey mapping** - Walk through use cases
5. **Future scenarios** - Envision education in 5-10 years

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Educational Impact**: How much does this improve learning?
- **Technical Feasibility**: Can this be implemented in JSON Schema?
- **Adoption Likelihood**: Will educators and publishers use this?
- **Maintenance Burden**: How complex is this to maintain?
- **Extensibility**: Does this enable future innovation?

## Output

- **Feature Concepts**: List saved to `.claude/memory/meetings/YYYY-MM-DD-ideation/concepts.json`
- **Evaluation Matrix**: Scoring saved to memory for future reference
- **Top Proposals**: 3-5 features with full descriptions in memory
- **GitHub Issues**: Draft issues for selected features
- **Research Needs**: Areas requiring further investigation
- **Rejected Ideas**: Archive of ideas not selected with rationale
