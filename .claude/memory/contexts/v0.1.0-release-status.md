### ðŸ”´ Open Critical Issues (2)
1. **Issue #26: Complete test infrastructure for v0.1.0 release** (Priority 1)

   - Sub-issues #21-#25 are marked complete but tests still failing
   - 14 tests failing, 61 passing locally
   
2. **Issue #23: Fix CI workflow test configuration** (Priority 1)

   - Blocking automated testing in PRs
   - Dependency on fixing local test failures

### ðŸŸ¡ Open Standard Issues (2)
3. **Issue #16: Setup CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions** (Priority 3)
   - Partially complete - CI exists but tests disabled
   - Need daily regression and release automation
   
4. **Issue #14: Create Schema Validation Test Suite** (Priority 3)
   - Partially complete - basic tests exist
   - Need comprehensive coverage (>90%)

## Test Infrastructure Analysis

### Current Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 75
- **Passing**: 61 (81.3%)
- **Failing**: 14 (18.7%)
- **Test Files**: 4 (2 failing, 2 passing)

### Failing Test Categories
1. CLI validation commands with real documents
2. Quiet flag behavior
3. JSON output formatting
4. Schema version selection
5. Integration tests for document validation

### Root Causes
- CLI command exit codes not properly handled
- Missing test fixtures or incorrect paths
- Schema loading issues in test environment

## Priority Recommendations

### ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Priority (Next 2-3 Issues)

#### 1. Issue #23: Fix CI workflow test configuration
**Why Critical**: 
- CI is currently non-functional for testing
- Blocks all PRs from proper validation
- Already has temporary workarounds that need removal
- Quick win - restore existing test commands

**Actions**:
- Remove placeholder echo statements
- Restore `npm run test:run` and `npm run test:coverage`
- Fix the 14 failing tests locally first
- Ensure tests pass in CI environment

#### 2. Issue #26: Complete test infrastructure 
**Why Critical**:
- Meta-issue tracking all test completion
- Tests are 81% passing but need 100% for release
- Blocks confident v0.1.0 release

**Actions**:
- Fix CLI command exit code handling
- Ensure all test fixtures exist and are valid
- Fix schema path resolution in tests
- Achieve 100% test pass rate

#### 3. Issue #16: Setup CI/CD Pipeline (Partial)
**Why Important**:
- CI exists but incomplete
- Need release automation for v0.1.0
- Should add version tagging and npm publishing

**Actions**:
- Complete release workflow
- Add changelog generation
- Setup npm publish automation
- Add nightly regression tests

### ðŸ“Š Release Readiness Assessment

**Core Functionality**: âœ… Complete
- Schema defined and validated
- Validator implemented and working
- Examples created and documented
- CLI tool functional

**Quality Assurance**: ðŸŸ¡ Partially Complete  
- Tests exist but 14 failing
- CI disabled for tests
- No automated release process

**Documentation**: âœ… Complete
- Architecture documented
- Quickstart guide written
- Reference documentation exists

## Recommendation

**Focus on getting tests to 100% pass rate first**. The v0.1.0 release has all core functionality complete, but cannot ship with failing tests. The priority order should be:

1. Fix the 14 failing tests locally (likely 1-2 hours of work)
2. Re-enable tests in CI workflow (15 minutes)
3. Verify CI passes on main branch
4. Setup basic release automation (2-3 hours)

Once tests are passing, the v0.1.0 milestone can be considered feature-complete and ready for release well ahead of the September 2025 target date.

## Non-Blocking Items for v0.1.0

These can be deferred or done in parallel:
- Issue #14: Comprehensive test coverage (can improve incrementally)
- Advanced CI features (nightly builds, performance benchmarks)
- Extended documentation beyond core requirements
