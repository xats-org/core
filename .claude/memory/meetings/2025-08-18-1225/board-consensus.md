**UNANIMOUS DECISION: HOLD PUBLIC RELEASE**
- v0.1.0 will NOT be promoted as production-ready

- No public announcements until v0.2.0 addresses blockers
- Rationale: 92% WCAG failure rate creates legal liability

**APPROVED: 8-WEEK EMERGENCY SPRINT**

#### Critical Blockers (Non-Negotiable)
1. **Assessment Framework** - 3 minimum types (MC, Short Answer, Essay)
