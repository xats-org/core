**Type:** Inaugural Board Meeting  
**Facilitator:** xats Project Steward

## Attendees (Agents Consulted)
- xats-project-steward (Board Chair)
- xats-schema-engineer (Technical Lead)
- xats-validation-engineer (Quality Assurance)
- xats-pedagogy-architect (Educational Design)
- xats-doc-writer (Documentation)

## Meeting Agenda
1. Review current project state
2. Identify critical gaps and missing components
3. Establish priorities for v0.1.0 release
4. Create actionable GitHub issues
5. Define project governance and workflow

## Key Findings

### Strengths Identified
1. **Strong Architectural Foundation**
   - Well-reasoned ADR with 14 architectural decisions
   - URI-based vocabulary system for extensibility
   - Smart adoption of CSL-JSON for bibliographic data
   - Clear schema structure with proper inheritance

2. **Documentation Framework**
   - Comprehensive architecture documentation
   - Clear roadmap with versioned milestones
   - Complete reference documentation structure
   - Contributing guidelines and Code of Conduct

### Critical Gaps Identified

#### 游댮 CRITICAL (Blocking v0.1.0)
1. **Empty Vocabulary Definitions** - All vocabulary JSON files are 0 bytes
2. **No Validation Infrastructure** - No test framework, validator, or CI/CD
3. **No Example Documents** - Examples directory empty except README
4. **ContentBlock Validation** - Content property has no type validation

#### 游리 HIGH PRIORITY
1. **Incomplete Documentation** - Quickstart tutorial incomplete
2. **No Project Infrastructure** - No GitHub milestones, labels, or boards
3. **Undefined Pathway Grammar** - Condition syntax not specified
4. **Missing Assessment Framework** - No assessment structures defined

#### 游릭 STANDARD PRIORITY
1. **No Extension Examples** - Extension system undefined in practice
2. **No Reference Renderer** - No implementation showing how to use schema
3. **Missing Versioning Strategy** - No migration or compatibility documentation

## Decisions Made

### 1. Development Priorities
**DECISION:** Focus on making v0.1.0 functional before adding features
- Priority 1: Implement vocabulary definitions
- Priority 2: Create validation infrastructure
- Priority 3: Develop example documents

### 2. Project Workflow
**DECISION:** Implement structured development process
- All work tracked via GitHub issues with milestones
- Feature branches for all changes
- PR reviews required from 2+ board members
- Automated testing on all PRs

### 3. Immediate Actions
**DECISION:** Block feature development until critical gaps addressed
- Issues #6-8 must be completed for v0.1.0
- No new features until validation works
- Focus on implementation over design

## GitHub Issues Created

### Critical Priority (游댮)
- #6: Implement Core Block Vocabulary Definitions
- #7: Create JSON Schema Validator and Test Infrastructure
- #8: Create Complete Example xats Documents
- #13: Implement Core Assessment Framework

### High Priority (游리)
- #9: Fix ContentBlock Validation Schema
- #10: Complete Quickstart Tutorial Documentation
- #11: Setup GitHub Project Infrastructure
- #12: Define Pathway Condition Grammar

### Standard Priority (游릭)
- #14: Create Schema Validation Test Suite
- #15: Develop Extension System Examples
- #16: Setup CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
- #17: Create Renderer Reference Implementation
- #18: Document Schema Versioning and Migration Strategy

## Action Items

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **[xats-schema-engineer]** Begin implementing core vocabulary definitions (Issue #6)
2. **[xats-validation-engineer]** Setup basic test infrastructure (Issue #7)
3. **[xats-doc-writer]** Create first valid example document (Issue #8)

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **[All]** Review and refine created issues
2. **[xats-project-steward]** Setup GitHub project board and milestones
3. **[xats-schema-engineer]** Fix ContentBlock validation issue

### Ongoing
1. Weekly board meetings to review progress
2. Public RFC process for major changes
3. Community engagement and feedback collection

## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks
1. **Schema Non-functional** - Without vocabulary definitions, schema cannot be used
2. **No Validation** - Cannot verify document compliance
3. **No Examples** - Adoption blocked without working examples

### Mitigation Strategy
- Focus all resources on Priority 1 issues
- Defer all feature work until core functions
- Daily standups during critical phase

## Next Meeting
- **Date:** TBD (within one week)
- **Agenda:** Review progress on critical issues
- **Required:** Status update on Issues #6, #7, #8

## Meeting Summary

The xats project has an excellent conceptual foundation with thoughtful architecture and clear vision. However, it currently lacks the concrete implementation needed to be functional. The most critical gap is the empty vocabulary definitions, which prevent any real documents from being created or validated.

The board unanimously agrees to focus on making the schema functional before adding new features. All board members commit to prioritizing the critical issues identified.

## Approval
This meeting record has been reviewed and approved by the xats Standards Board.
