# v0.4.0 Roadmap Recommendations
**Based on Board Meeting:** August 19, 2025  
**Approved by:** xats Standards Board (Unanimous)

## Executive Summary

The board unanimously approved a significant revision to the v0.4.0 roadmap, accelerating AI integration features and adding critical rendering capabilities. These changes position xats as a leader in AI-enhanced educational content while maintaining our commitment to academic rigor and accessibility.

## Approved v0.4.0 Features

### 1. Rendering Hints Expansion ⭐ **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Status:** ✅ Approved  
**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks  
**Lead:** xats-schema-engineer

**Description:** Expand the current `renderingHints` system with semantic intent vocabulary to better convey author pedagogical intent while maintaining renderer flexibility.

**Key Components:**
- URI-based semantic intent vocabulary
- Pedagogical role classification (core-concept, example, definition, warning, tip, exercise)
- Prominence levels (low, medium, high, critical)
- Visual treatment guidelines
- Backward compatibility with existing implementations

**Schema Enhancement Example:**
```json
{
  "renderingHints": {
    "intent": "https://xats.org/rendering/intents/keyConceptHighlight",
    "prominence": "high",
    "pedagogicalRole": "core-concept",
    "visualTreatment": {
      "emphasis": "strong",
      "spacing": "increased",
      "backgroundTreatment": "subtle"
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Preserves pedagogical intent across different presentation modes
- Enables consistent rendering across platforms
- Supports accessibility through semantic meaning
- Facilitates automated content adaptation

### 2. AI Integration Framework ⭐ **HIGH PRIORITY** 
**Status:** ✅ Approved (accelerated from v0.5.0)  
**Timeline:** 8-12 weeks

**Description:** Comprehensive framework for AI-powered content generation and multi-agent collaboration using xats as the data interchange format.

**Key Components:**

#### A. AI Generation Metadata Extension
```json
{
  "extensions": {
    "aiGeneration": {
      "generated": true,
      "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
      "prompt": "Create an assessment for learning objective X",
      "timestamp": "2025-08-19T20:41:00Z",
      "humanReviewed": false,
      "confidence": 0.87,
      "reviewStatus": "pending"
    }
  }
}
```

#### B. MCP Server Implementation
- Model Context Protocol server for AI tool integration
- Native xats document validation and manipulation
- Schema-aware content generation capabilities
- Multi-agent collaboration coordination

#### C. Agent Orchestration Protocol
- Standardized handoff mechanism between AI agents
- Shared memory through xats document structure
- Context preservation across collaborative sessions
- Quality assurance checkpoints

**Benefits:**
- Democratizes high-quality educational content creation
- Enables specialized AI collaboration (content, assessment, accessibility)
- Maintains human oversight and educational quality
- Positions xats as AI-ready standard

### 3. R-markdown Renderer 🔄 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Status:** ✅ Approved  
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks (parallel development)  
**Lead:** xats-publishing-expert

**Description:** Native renderer to convert xats documents into R-markdown format for seamless integration with academic publishing and data analysis workflows.

**Key Components:**
- Convert xats semantic structures to R-markdown equivalents
- Preserve bibliographic integrity with R's citation system
- Support code blocks for R execution
- Maintain assessment structures in markdown format
- YAML frontmatter generation from xats metadata

**Output Example:**
```yaml
---
title: "Introduction to Statistics"
author: "Dr. Smith"
bibliography: references.bib
csl: apa.csl
---

# Chapter 1: Basic Concepts

:::{.key-concept}
**Central Limit Theorem**: The distribution of sample means...
:::

```{r data-analysis}
summary(dataset)
```
```

**Benefits:**
- Integrates with existing academic workflows
- Enables data-driven content creation
- Supports reproducible research practices
- Expands xats ecosystem reach
