# xats Stakeholder Feedback Report
**Date:** August 18, 2025  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive stakeholder feedback on v0.1.0 and requirements for v0.2.0 and v0.3.0
**Status:** For Board Review

---

## Executive Summary

The xats v0.1.0 release has successfully established a strong technical foundation with excellent semantic structure, extensible architecture, and robust JSON Schema validation. However, **critical functionality gaps prevent any meaningful adoption** by students, educators, publishers, or institutions.

### Key Finding
**v0.1.0 is a technical proof-of-concept, not a usable educational standard.** While the architecture is sound, the schema lacks essential features that all stakeholder groups require for basic functionality.

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Issues
1. **Legal Liability** - Accessibility non-compliance exposes institutions to lawsuits
2. **Market Rejection** - Without assessments, no educational institution will adopt
3. **Publisher Abandonment** - Rights management gaps prevent commercial use
4. **Competition** - Other standards (QTI, Common Cartridge) already have these features

### Mitigation Strategy
1. **Emergency Sprint** - Dedicate resources to assessment and accessibility
2. **Partner Early** - Work with disability advocates and pilot institutions
3. **Phased Rollout** - v0.2.0 for early adopters, v0.3.0 for mainstream
4. **Clear Communication** - Be transparent about current limitations

---

## Recommendations for the Board

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Reprioritize v0.2.0** - Focus exclusively on blockers
2. **Form Working Groups** - Assessment, Accessibility, Rights Management
3. **Partner Selection** - Identify pilot institutions and publishers
4. **Tool Development** - Start on authoring tools immediately

### Strategic Decisions
1. **Delay v0.1.0 Promotion** - Do not market as production-ready
2. **Accelerate v0.2.0** - Target Q2 2025 instead of Q3
3. **Resource Allocation** - Prioritize assessment and accessibility
4. **Community Engagement** - Be transparent about roadmap changes

### Success Metrics for v0.2.0
- [ ] 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] 5+ assessment block types
- [ ] 3+ LMS successful integrations
- [ ] 10+ authors successfully create content
- [ ] 2+ publishers commit to pilot

## Conclusion

The xats project has built an excellent technical foundation in v0.1.0, but **cannot achieve its mission without addressing critical functionality gaps**. The unanimous stakeholder feedback is clear: **assessment, accessibility, and rights management are non-negotiable for v0.2.0**.

The good news is that the architectural decisions in v0.1.0 (semantic structure, extensibility, URI vocabularies) provide an ideal platform for these additions. With focused effort on the identified blockers, xats can become the leading standard for AI-driven, accessible, and pedagogically sound educational content.

**The path forward is clear, but requires immediate and decisive action.**
