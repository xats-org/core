# xats Board Meeting: File Modularity for v0.3.0

**Date:** August 18, 2025  
**Time:** 23:33  
**Meeting Type:** Focused Technical Discussion  
**Chair:** xats-project-steward

## Meeting Purpose

Evaluate and design file modularity capabilities for xats v0.3.0 to address scalability concerns for large textbooks and complex educational materials.

## Background

Current xats schema requires all content to be contained within a single JSON file. For large textbooks with hundreds of pages, multiple authors, or modular content that needs to be reused across documents, this creates several challenges:

- **File Size**: Single files become unwieldy to edit and version control
- **Collaboration**: Multiple authors cannot easily work on different sections simultaneously
- **Reusability**: Content cannot be easily shared between different textbooks
- **Performance**: Large files impact loading and processing times
- **Modularity**: No way to create component libraries or shared content pools

## Attendees

### Core Technical Team
- **xats-schema-engineer** - Technical implementation design
- **xats-validation-engineer** - Cross-file validation strategies

### Implementation Partners  
- **xats-content-author** - Authoring workflow and user experience
- **xats-publishing-expert** - Publishing pipeline integration
- **xats-lms-integrator** - LMS compatibility and performance

## Agenda Items

### 1. Use Cases and Requirements (15 minutes)
- Large textbook scenarios (1000+ pages, multiple chapters)
- Multi-author collaboration workflows
- Content reusability and component libraries
- Modular course materials
- Performance and loading considerations

### 2. Technical Approaches (20 minutes)
- JSON Schema $ref mechanism vs custom URI schemes
- File organization patterns and conventions
- Resolution strategies (relative paths, absolute URIs, registry-based)
- Dependency management and circular reference prevention
- Version compatibility across referenced files

### 3. Validation and Quality Assurance (15 minutes)
- Cross-file validation strategies
- Dependency resolution during validation
- Error reporting for missing or invalid references
- Testing frameworks for multi-file documents

### 4. Workflow and Tooling Impact (15 minutes)
- Authoring tool requirements
- Publishing pipeline modifications
- LMS integration considerations
- Version control best practices

### 5. Security and Safety (10 minutes)
- Path traversal prevention
- Sandboxing and access controls
- Trusted vs untrusted content sources
- Validation of referenced content integrity

### 6. Implementation Planning (10 minutes)
- Backward compatibility strategy
- Migration path for existing documents
- Phased rollout approach
- Timeline for v0.3.0 delivery

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Technical Requirements Document** - Clear specification of file modularity features
2. **Implementation Approach** - Recommended technical solution with alternatives
3. **Risk Assessment** - Identified challenges and mitigation strategies
4. **Project Plan** - Next steps and milestone assignments for v0.3.0

## Pre-Meeting Materials

- Current xats v0.2.0 schema structure
- JSON Schema $ref specification review
