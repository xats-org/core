# xats Board Meeting: Project Structure for Tooling Phase
**Date:** August 19, 2025  
**Time:** 21:55  
**Meeting Type:** Critical Strategic Decision  
**Chair:** xats-project-steward  

## Meeting Participants
- **xats-schema-engineer** - Technical architecture perspective
- **xats-dev-lead** - Development workflow perspective  
- **xats-doc-writer** - Documentation organization
- **xats-implementation-guide** - Third-party developer perspective
- **xats-consumer-advocate** - Ease of adoption perspective
- **xats-publishing-expert** - Commercial viability
- **dx-optimizer** - Developer experience
- **project-architect** - Best practices and scalability
- **deployment-engineer** - CI/CD and deployment perspective

## Context & Urgency
With xats v0.3.0 successfully released containing the core schema, we are entering the tooling phase (v0.4.0 and beyond). We need to make a critical decision about project structure before we begin development of validators, renderers, MCP servers, CLI tools, and other ecosystem components.

## Current State
- **Single repository:** `xats-org/core` contains everything
- **Current components:** Schema, validation tools, examples, documentation
- **Upcoming components (v0.4.0+):** MCP server, advanced renderers, CLI tools, AI integration framework, R-markdown renderer, analytics platform

## Agenda

### 1. Current State Analysis (15 minutes)
**Lead:** xats-schema-engineer
- Review current single-repo structure and components
- Identify pain points in current development workflow
- Assess benefits of current approach
- Evaluate developer onboarding experience

### 2. Future Requirements Assessment (20 minutes)  
**Lead:** project-architect
- Catalog all planned components from roadmap v0.4.0-v0.9.0
- Estimate growth trajectory and complexity
- Identify interdependencies between components
- Assess third-party contribution patterns

### 3. Architecture Options Evaluation (30 minutes)

#### Option A: Continue Monorepo Approach
**Lead:** xats-dev-lead
- Benefits: Simplified versioning, shared dependencies, atomic changes
- Tools: Turborepo, Nx, pnpm workspaces, Lerna
- Examples: React, Babel, Next.js approach

#### Option B: Multi-Repository Structure  
**Lead:** deployment-engineer
- Benefits: Independent release cycles, clear ownership, focused contributions
- Coordination: GitHub Organizations, shared actions, standardized workflows
- Examples: Vue ecosystem, webpack ecosystem approach

#### Option C: Hybrid Approach
**Lead:** dx-optimizer  
- Core schema + tooling monorepo with separate ecosystem repos
- Identify which components belong together vs. separately

### 4. Evaluation Criteria Deep Dive (25 minutes)

#### Developer Experience  
**Lead:** dx-optimizer
- Onboarding complexity for contributors
- Local development setup and testing
- Cross-component development workflows

#### Third-Party Adoption Ease
**Lead:** xats-implementation-guide  
- Package discovery and installation
- Version management for implementers
- Documentation organization and findability

#### Maintenance Overhead
**Lead:** project-architect
- CI/CD complexity and resource usage
- Dependency management across components
- Release coordination effort

#### Community Contribution Barriers
**Lead:** xats-consumer-advocate
- Contribution complexity for different skill levels
- Issue tracking and project management
- Code review and approval workflows

#### Documentation Strategy
**Lead:** xats-doc-writer
- Multi-component documentation organization
- Cross-referencing and version alignment
- User journey optimization

#### Commercial Publishing Viability
**Lead:** xats-publishing-expert
- Enterprise adoption considerations
- Support and stability perception
- Integration complexity for publishers

### 5. Benchmark Analysis (15 minutes)
**Lead:** project-architect
Review how major JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystems handle similar challenges:
- **React:** Monorepo with multiple packages
- **Vue:** Multi-repo with coordinated releases  
- **Angular:** Monorepo with clear package boundaries
- **webpack:** Multi-repo with ecosystem coordination
- **TypeScript:** Monorepo with modular architecture

### 6. Risk Assessment (10 minutes)
**Lead:** deployment-engineer
- Technical risks for each approach
- Timeline and resource implications
- Migration complexity if we need to change later

### 7. Recommendation & Decision (20 minutes)
**Lead:** xats-project-steward
- Present consensus recommendation
- Outline implementation timeline
- Define success criteria and review points
- Assign action items and next steps

## Decision Framework
Each option will be scored (1-5) on:
1. **Developer Experience** - How easy is it for contributors?
2. **Third-Party Adoption** - How easy for implementers to use our tools?
3. **Maintenance Burden** - How much overhead does this create?
4. **Scalability** - How well does this handle our 5-year roadmap?
5. **Documentation Quality** - How well can we organize and maintain docs?
6. **Commercial Viability** - How does this affect enterprise adoption?

## Expected Outcomes
1. Clear recommendation with rationale
2. Implementation timeline and milestones
3. Migration plan (if structure change needed)
4. Identified risks and mitigation strategies
5. Assigned ownership for next steps

## Reference Materials
