# CRISIS RESPONSE PLAN: v0.1.0 Release Emergency
**Date:** August 18, 2025  
**Author:** xats-project-steward  
**Status:** EMERGENCY - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

---

## Executive Summary

Based on unanimous stakeholder feedback revealing critical blockers, **xats v0.1.0 cannot be publicly announced in its current state**. This constitutes a product crisis requiring immediate intervention and resource reallocation.

### Crisis Scope
- **Legal Risk:** 92% WCAG failure rate creates institutional liability
- **Zero Adoption Potential:** No educational use possible without assessment framework
- **Commercial Blocker:** Publishers cannot adopt without rights management
- **Reputation Risk:** Public announcement would damage project credibility permanently

---

## IMMEDIATE DECISIONS

### 1. v0.1.0 Release Status: HALTED
**Decision:** NO public announcement or promotion of v0.1.0 as production-ready

**Rationale:** 
- All stakeholder groups confirm v0.1.0 is unusable for real-world applications
- Legal liability from accessibility non-compliance
- Would damage project credibility and early adopter relationships

**Actions:**
- Cancel any planned v0.1.0 marketing or announcements
- Update project documentation to mark v0.1.0 as "Technical Preview"
- Communicate internally that v0.1.0 is foundation-only, not feature-complete

### 2. v0.2.0 Reprioritization: EMERGENCY SPRINT
**Decision:** Complete restructuring of v0.2.0 to address critical blockers

**New v0.2.0 Scope (Emergency Priorities):**

#### Priority 1: Legal/Compliance Blockers
1. **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance** - Must achieve 100% compliance
2. **Rights Management Framework** - Essential for commercial adoption
3. **Language Identification** - Required for accessibility and i18n

#### Priority 2: Educational Functionality Blockers  
1. **Core Assessment Framework** - Minimum viable assessment system
2. **Feedback and Scoring** - Essential for student engagement
3. **LTI 1.3 Foundation** - Basic LMS integration

#### Priority 3: Usability Blockers
1. **Authoring Tool Foundation** - Markdown-like syntax
2. **Common Content Types** - Definitions, examples, warnings
3. **Basic Student Features** - Notes, bookmarks, progress

**Deferred to v0.3.0:**
- Advanced assessment types
- Production workflows  
- AI integration features
- Internationalization beyond language tags

### 3. Resource Allocation: WAR ROOM MODE
**Decision:** Emergency resource reallocation for focused sprints

**Immediate Resource Deployment:**
- **Assessment Sprint Team:** xats-schema-engineer, xats-pedagogy-architect, xats-assessment-specialist
- **Accessibility Sprint Team:** xats-accessibility-champion, xats-validation-engineer, external WCAG expert
- **Rights Management Sprint Team:** xats-publishing-expert, xats-schema-engineer, legal consultant

**Timeline:** 8-week emergency sprints (targeting early November 2025)

### 4. Communication Strategy: TRANSPARENT ACCOUNTABILITY
**Decision:** Full transparency about timeline changes and current limitations

**External Communications:**
- Blog post: "xats v0.1.0: Strong Foundation, Critical Next Steps"
- Stakeholder update: Honest assessment of current state and roadmap changes
- Community notice: v0.2.0 delayed but will address all blockers

**Internal Communications:**
- Board emergency session: Resource allocation and accountability
- Weekly crisis response meetings with sprint teams
- Daily standups for each sprint team

### 5. Emergency GitHub Issues: IMMEDIATE CREATION
**Decision:** Create comprehensive GitHub issues for all critical blockers

## Accountability and Oversight

As project steward, I take full responsibility for this crisis and commit to:

1. **Daily oversight** of all emergency sprint teams
2. **Weekly reporting** to the board and stakeholders
3. **Quality assurance** that no corners are cut on critical features

**The future of educational technology standards depends on getting v0.2.0 right.**
