# GitHub Issues Dependency Analysis - Executive Summary
**Date**: August 18, 2025  
**Analyst**: xats-project-steward  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

## Actions Taken

### ‚úÖ Issue Updates Completed
Updated all critical v0.2.0 issues with proper dependency relationships:

1. **#38** - Assessment Framework - **FOUNDATION** (no dependencies)
2. **#39** - WCAG Compliance - **FOUNDATION** (no dependencies)  
3. **#40** - Rights Management - **FOUNDATION** (no dependencies)
4. **#41** - LTI Integration - **DEPENDS ON**: #38 + #39
5. **#36** - Authoring Tools - **DEPENDS ON**: #38 + #40
6. **#3** - Formative Assessment - **DEPENDS ON**: #38
7. **#2** - Cognitive Metadata - **DEPENDS ON**: #38

### ‚úÖ Duplicates Closed
Consolidated duplicate issues into primary issues:
- **Assessment**: Closed #32, #1, #13 ‚Üí Primary: #38
- **WCAG**: Closed #33 ‚Üí Primary: #39
- **Rights**: Closed #34 ‚Üí Primary: #40
- **LTI**: Closed #35 ‚Üí Primary: #41

## Critical Path Identified

### üöÄ START IMMEDIATELY (Phase 1 - Parallel)
These have NO dependencies and block everything else:
- **#38** - Assessment Framework (8 weeks)
- **#39** - WCAG Compliance (6 weeks)
- **#40** - Rights Management (4 weeks)  
- **#42** - External Audit (2 weeks)

### ‚è≥ WAIT FOR DEPENDENCIES (Phase 2)
Cannot start until Phase 1 dependencies are ‚â•80% complete:
- **#41** - LTI Integration (needs #38 + #39)
- **#36** - Authoring Tools (needs #38 + #40)

### üéØ ENHANCEMENT TIER (Phase 3)
Cannot start until core assessment (#38) is ‚â•80% complete:
- **#3** - Formative Assessment
- **#2** - Cognitive Metadata

## Timeline Overview

| Week | Phase 1 Foundation | Phase 2 Dependent | Phase 3 Enhancement |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1-8  | All 4 issues running | ‚ùå **DO NOT START** | ‚ùå **DO NOT START** |
| 9-14 | Complete | #41, #36 can start | #3, #2 can start |

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Do not start Phase 2 work until Phase 1 dependencies are substantially complete. Starting early will waste resources on potentially changing requirements.

## Risk Analysis

### HIGHEST RISK - Project Killers
- **#38 Assessment Framework**: Without this, xats has no educational value
- **#39 WCAG Compliance**: Legal liability blocks all public release

### HIGH RISK - Adoption Blockers  
- **#41 LTI Integration**: Blocks all institutional adoption
- **#40 Rights Management**: Blocks all commercial adoption

## Team Recommendations

### Immediate Sprint Team Formation
1. **Assessment Team** ‚Üí #38 (highest priority)
2. **Accessibility Team** ‚Üí #39 + #42 coordination  
3. **Rights Team** ‚Üí #40 (shortest timeline)

### Resource Allocation
- **70%** of development resources on Phase 1 issues
- **0%** on Phase 2 until dependencies met (avoid premature work)
- **30%** on planning and external contractor management

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success (Required by Week 8)
- [ ] Assessment blocks defined and validated
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance achieved  
- [ ] Rights management extension implemented
- [ ] External audit complete with remediation plan

### Phase 2 Success (Required by Week 14)
- [ ] LTI 1.3 integration working with 3+ LMS platforms
- [ ] Authoring tools can create assessments with rights metadata

## Next Actions for Project Leadership

1. **TODAY**: Form Phase 1 sprint teams
2. **THIS WEEK**: Hire external accessibility auditor (#42)
3. **ONGOING**: Weekly dependency check meetings
4. **CRITICAL**: Do not allow Phase 2 work to start prematurely
