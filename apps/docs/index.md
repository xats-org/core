## What is xats?

The **Extensible Academic Textbook Schema (xats)** is a comprehensive JSON-based standard designed specifically for educational content. It provides a deeply semantic, machine-readable format that enables AI-driven educational tools to generate, deconstruct, and repurpose educational materials with unprecedented precision.

## Quick Example

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "0.4.0",
  "bibliographicEntry": {
    "type": "book",
    "title": "Introduction to Computer Science",
    "author": [{"literal": "Jane Doe"}]
  },
  "subject": "Computer Science",
  "bodyMatter": {
    "contents": [
      {
        "id": "unit-1",
        "label": "Unit 1",
        "title": {
          "runs": [{"type": "text", "text": "Programming Fundamentals"}]
        },
        "chapters": [
          {
            "id": "chapter-1-1",
            "label": "Chapter 1",
            "title": {
              "runs": [{"type": "text", "text": "Variables and Data Types"}]
            },
            "contentBlocks": [
              {
                "id": "intro-paragraph",
                "blockType": "https://xats.org/core/blocks/paragraph",
                "content": {
                  "text": {
                    "runs": [
                      {
                        "type": "text",
                        "text": "In programming, variables are containers for storing data values."
                      }
                    ]
                  }
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
