For instance, clustering customers based on purchasing behavior without knowing predefined customer types.\n\n• **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns through trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties for actions. A classic example is training a computer to play chess by playing many games and learning from wins and losses."}
